# Affine Cipher
Similar to the Ceaser cipher, the affine cipher is a 
character based cipher that use a tuple as a key `(a,b)`
and encrypts a plaintext character `x` to the ciphertext
character `y` by `y = ax + b`.

The cli interface is improved from the ceaser cipher,
allowing the user to store the key, avoiding
passing the key explicitly for every encrypt and decrypt
operation.
